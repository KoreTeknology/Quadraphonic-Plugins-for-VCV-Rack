# Quadraphonic-Plugins-for-VCV-Rack

> This page is in progress, please, come back soon !

This is an educational project, based on the creation a set of **Modules** for VCV Rack.

The final documentation will have several sections like:
- **How to plan your Module Development**, from idea to project planning
- **How to make a new Module**, an advanced tutorial on the Quadratrack mixer development
- **How to use/test your new module in VCV Rack**, a complete manual of using VCV Rack and testing modules process

The initial project was to create a serie of Modules, used for quadraphonic performances. The concept was developped 20 yars ago but only few hardware prototypes were made at this time. The objective is to recreate theses concepts in a virtual environment (VCV) and add some extra features. Here is a list of needed "components":

- **QuadraTrack**, a Single Mono Input track to 4 outputs with controls and options
- **QuadraPhrase**, an advanced sequencer to control the Quadratrack mix during performances
- **QuadraMaster**, An output section with 4 audio inputs/outputs with effects and options
- **QuadraPlayer**, a 4 tracks recorder/player, audio/midi from files, with 4 outputs

I can consider this project as a WIP (work in progress), files will be updated on major upgrades without deadline until the complete documentation will be published. it start with a pdf format for printing purpose and a set of files, organized by chapters.

The complete work of documentation is released under Open document license and the modules files is release under Open source license.
